/** 
 * @mainpage Brain, a framework for Robotino
 *
 * Brain is a framework for Robotino based on RobotinoAPI2.
 *
 * Brain builds upon RobotinoAPI2 to provide a higher layer of abstraction, which enables a developer or user to give orders rather than specific, low-level instructions.
 *
 * This relase includes
 * 	- Brain, the framework
 * 	- A collection of geometry classes used by Brain
 * 	- KinectReader, a class for reading coordinates from a Kinect connected to a remove server
 * 	- TcpSocket, a tcp socket library used by KinectReader
 * 
 * A class for Control and a functional main.cpp is also provided for demonstrational purposes.
 *
 * For more information about Robotino and RobotinoAPI2, see http://wiki.openrobotino.org
